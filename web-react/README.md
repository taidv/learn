# Notes

## About building
You need to run `npm install` in ./, ./projects/api and ./projects/ui folder
You may need to install pushd/popd in Windows:
`sudo aptitude install libfile-pushd-perl`

## About developping
You can either do `gulp && npm start` at the root level or run both `gulp && npm start` in projects/api and `npm start` in projects/ui (it is a bit faster and reloads code from the ui automatically)
